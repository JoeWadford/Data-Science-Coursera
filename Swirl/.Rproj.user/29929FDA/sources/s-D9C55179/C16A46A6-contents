# select() the following columns from cran. Keep in mind
# that when you're using the chaining operator, you don't
# need to specify the name of the data tbl in your call to
# select().
#
# 1. ip_id
# 2. country
# 3. package
# 4. size
#
# The call to print() at the end of the chain is optional,
# but necessary if you want your results printed to the
# console. Note that since there are no additional arguments
# to print(), you can leave off the parentheses after
# the function name. This is a convenient feature of the %>%
# operator.
